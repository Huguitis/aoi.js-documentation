`$cooldown` will set a user-based cooldown.

## Usage

```php
$cooldown[time;errorMessage?]
```

* You are able to retrieve the remaining cooldown in the `$cooldown` function by using **`%time%`**.

## Parameters

| Field         | Type   | Description                                                | Required |
|---------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| time          | string | the duration of the cooldown                               | true     |
| errorMessage? | string | error message when there's remaining time for the cooldown | false    |

## Example

This will set a cooldown for a command which applies to the user only and returns the remaining cooldown:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: 'cooldown',
    code: `
  hello
  $cooldown[2m;Please wait %time% to execute this command again.]
  `
});
```
