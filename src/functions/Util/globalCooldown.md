`$globalCooldown` will set a global-based cooldown for a command.

## Usage

```php
$globalCooldown[time;errorMessage?]
```

* You are able to retrieve the remaining cooldown in the `$globalCooldown` function by using **`%time%`**.

## Parameters

| Field         | Type   | Description                                                     | Required |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| time          | string | the duration of the cooldown                                    | true     |
| errorMessage? | string | error message given when there's remaining time of the cooldown | false    |

## Example

This will return `Hello` and stop anyone from executing the command again for another five minutes:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: 'globalCooldown',
    code: `
  Hello
  $globalCooldown[5m;Please wait %time% to execute this command again.]
  `
});
```
