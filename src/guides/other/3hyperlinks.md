**This page is about hyperlinks, what they do and how to use them.**

Hyperlinks are useful to hide long links in text, this has limitation as it only works in Interactions (application commands) and embeds.

### Embedding Links

First of all you require a link you want to embed, let's take `https://aoi.js.org` for example.

Then do the following;

1. Surround the link with brackets, looking like this;

```php
(https://aoi.js.org)
```

2. Choose the text you want to be clickable and put that one in-front of the link looking like this;

```php
[Awesome Hyperlink!](https://aoi.js.org)
```

That works the same way for embeds as for application commands.

If you want to customize the "hovertag", then do the following;

```php
[Awesome Hyperlink!](https://aoi.js.org "Hover Text")
```
