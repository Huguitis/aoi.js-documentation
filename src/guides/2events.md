**aoi.js** has various event listeners, known as "events", that cater to the majority of events provided by the Discord
API.

Each of them has its own usage and command type for executing specific tasks (for example, for logging purposes).

The events are not mandatory, apart from **`onMessage`** (which is required for the bot to read and send messages), but
if you wish to utilise them, they must be included in your main file, in order for the bot to listen for those events.
This is necessary in order to make use of the different command types.

It's worth bearing in mind that in order to utilise certain events, you'll need to activate your intents on the Discord
Developer Portal.
