### Bot Status

#### This section will cover how to customize your bot's status.

First of all we have to add the following piece of code to our main file:
```js
bot.status({
  text: "Example Text!",
  type: "PLAYING",
  time: 12
});
```
This will display the text "Example Text!" as bot status, of course you can modify it.

If you want to have multiple statuses just add multiple `bot.status({...})`, simple do the following:
```js
bot.status({
  text: "Example Text!",
  type: "PLAYING",
  time: 12
});

bot.status({
  text: "Example Text!",
  type: "WATCHING",
  time: 20
});

bot.status({
  text: "Example Text!",
  type: "STEAMING",
  url: "URL"
});
```

There are various types of statuses:

> * **PLAYING**
> * **WATCHING**
> * **STREAMING** 
> * **LISTENING**
> * **COMPETING**

### Client Presence 

You can also set the bot's presence, by adding the `status` property, for example:
```js
bot.status({
  text: "Example Text!",
  type: "PLAYING",
  status: "dnd",
  time: 12
});
```

There are multiple types of presences:

> * **online**
> * **idle**
> * **dnd** 
> * **invisible**
> * **mobilePlatform**  
  > To use the mobile presence you have to change your setup in your main file and add `mobilePlatform: true`:
  ```js
 const aoijs = require("aoi.js");
 
 const bot = new aoijs.AoiClient({
   token: "DISCORD BOT TOKEN",
   prefix: "DISCORD BOT PREFIX",
   intents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "MessageContent"],
   events: ["onMessage"],
   mobilePlatform: true
 });
 ```
